<p>Yes, we process both B&W and color (C-41) negative film in-house! That includes disposable cameras, and a variety of vintage film sizes (see sizes on our price chart). As long as the products are needed and materials are available, we intend to keep providing these services.</p>

<p>When the NY Times published an article about the last processing run of Kodachrome slide film in 2010, it left the impression that ALL film is a thing of the past. Au contraire! Just because Kodachrome is no longer available does not mean film is dead. Slide film is even still available, but it is the E-6 processed variety, not the K-14 Kodachrome of days gone by. Due to declining demand, we no longer process E-6 slide film in-house, but we can send it to an affiliated IPI lab upon request.</p> 

<p>We believe that film is still the most versatile of all storage media. Digital files, while being incredibly convenient, do have their limitations: they are resolution specific and all may not be suitable for enlargement, especially EXTREME enlargement. Film still offers almost limitless possibilities, since individual images can be scanned for virtually any output size desired.</p>

<p>After processing, film can be cut into strips and placed in archival plastic sleeves, or can be left uncut upon request, either sleeved or unsleeved.
